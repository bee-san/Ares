## About ciphey

ciphey is the next generation of decoding tools, built by the same people that brought you [Ciphey](https://github.com/ciphey/ciphey). It's designed to automatically detect and decode various types of encoded or encrypted text, including (but not limited to) Base64, Hexadecimal, Caesar cipher, ROT13, URL encoding, and many more.

Key features include:

- Significantly faster performance (up to 700% faster than Ciphey)
- Library-first architecture for easy integration
- Advanced search algorithms for efficient decoding
- Built-in timeout mechanism
- Comprehensive documentation and testing
- Support for multi-level encodings

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started with ciphey is to install it via Cargo:

```bash
cargo install ciphey
```

Then use it with the `ciphey` command:

```bash
ciphey "your encoded text here"
```

For more detailed instructions, see the [Using ciphey](using_ciphey.md) guide.
