# Packing ciphey

Please call the main ciphey program (the CLI) `ciphey_cli` and enable it to be called via `ciphey` in the terminal.

This is because `ciphey` is a short name and is probably taken in a package manager already.

## Releases

Please base your package on our releases and not our GitHub repo. If you must, please call the package `ciphey_cli_rolling` to ensure people understand that the package updates on a rolling basis (as our GitHub repo updates).
