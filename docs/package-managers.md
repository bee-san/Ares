# Packing Ares

Please call the main Ares program (the CLI) `ares_cli` and enable it to be called via `ares` in the terminal.

This is because `Ares` is a short name and is probably taken in a package manager already.

## Releases

Please base your package on our releases and not our GitHub repo. If you must, please call the package `ares_cli_rolling` to ensure people understand that the package updates on a rolling basis (as our GitHub repo updates).
