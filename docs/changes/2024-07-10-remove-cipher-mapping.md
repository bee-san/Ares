# Change: Remove CIPHER_MAPPING from helper_functions

## Purpose
Remove the incorrect mapping between Cipher Identifier's cipher names and Ares decoder names. The mapping was inaccurate, particularly with "fractionatedMorse" being incorrectly mapped to "morseCode" when they are different encoding schemes.

## Trade-offs
### Advantages
- Removes incorrect mappings that could lead to misidentification of ciphers
- Simplifies the code by directly using the first result from Cipher Identifier
- Eliminates potential confusion between different cipher types

### Disadvantages
- No longer filters cipher types based on available decoders
- May return cipher types that don't have corresponding decoders in Ares

## Technical Implementation
- Removed the `CIPHER_MAPPING` static variable and its documentation
- Modified the `get_cipher_identifier_score` function to return the first result from Cipher Identifier instead of checking against the mapping
- Verified that all tests still pass after the changes

## Future Improvements
- Consider implementing a more accurate mapping if needed in the future
- Potentially add a check to verify if Ares has a decoder for the identified cipher type
- Could add a more sophisticated scoring mechanism for cipher identification
