<h1>Project Ares</h1>
</p>

Ares is the next generation of decoding tools, built by the same people that brought you [Ciphey](https://github.com/ciphey/ciphey).

We fully intend to replace [Ciphey](https://github.com/ciphey/ciphey) with Ares.

This has minimal features, currently it supports only Base64 & reverse encoder with minimal ability to check for plaintext.
