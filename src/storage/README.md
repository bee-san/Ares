# What is this?

Storage is a module which deals with storing things. In the life time of Ares, we'll want to:
* Store word lists
* Dictionaries
* Crack results, keys, what the plaintext is
* Other language dictionaries


And more. Storage is a way to access this information, handling errors and caching them to speed up the program.
